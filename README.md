# Give-Life_-Predict-Blood-Donations
Our dataset is from a mobile blood donation vehicle in Taiwan. The Blood Transfusion Service Center drives to different universities and collects blood as part of a blood drive. 
We want to predict whether or not a donor will give blood the next time the vehicle comes to campus.
In this project i am using TPOT.
TPOT is a Python Automated Machine Learning tool that optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming.
